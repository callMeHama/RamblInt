<h1>Rambling Web Display</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>

Hi.. Didn't think you'll find such project. It is an extremely simple one, displaying some modifiable client-side elements and giving space to add server-side features as well (See [Register](Register.html) and [FAQ](QnA.html)).

The site has the following:
- Displayed imaginary info
- Dynamic search feature

<h2>Running the system</h2>

You don't need to do anything other than put the files in a shared directory. Everything should work with just that.

**Have a great day!**
